## Current Challenges with the Cloning Tool

I currently have a cloning tool that operates based on trade versions. However, this tool relies on outdated Perl scripts and GTRS database queries, which contain several bugs due to their lack of maintenance. 

### Issues Faced
- **Cloning Limitations**: Quality Assurance (QA) teams are unable to clone trades based on specific conditions. This limitation becomes problematic when multiple records exist for a given trade and version, necessitating repeated executions of the cloning process with manual adjustments.
  
- **Dependency on External Database**: We are also reliant on the Reflow database, which is not under our control. The QA Engineering Management (QAEM) team has the authority to purge our records without prior notice.

- **Data Inconsistency**: Since trade data is sourced from multiple origins, the outdated queries lead to inconsistencies and incomplete information. Additionally, parallel processing of trade data within the Reflow database is causing further complications.

## Proposed Solution: New Cloning Tool

To address these challenges, we have developed a new cloning tool that resolves these issues effectively:

- **Enhanced Processing**: This new tool supports parallel processing and utilizes our GTR test plan database, which we fully control.

- **User Control and Flexibility**: Users will have the ability to filter and select specific trade records for cloning without any imposed conditions.

- **Technology Upgrade**: We are implementing this tool using Python and DB2, backed by a skilled team with expertise in these technologies.

- **Rule Implementation**: A new feature allows users to stub values for trades of LCE (Last Change Event) and clone the LCE as well.

- **Single Source of Truth**: Trade data will now be sourced from Qwest, ensuring consistency and reliability. With our own database queries, we will maintain clear ownership over the data.

- **Improved Speed**: The new tool is designed for faster performance compared to the existing solution.

This comprehensive update promises to streamline our cloning process while enhancing data integrity and user experience.
