Pre-Implementation
"Conduct discovery and design sessions to gather requirements, assess feasibility, and plan the architecture for an effective GenAI-driven autohealing solution."
During Implementation
"Develop, train, and test the model, then integrate it with GTRS systems to ensure accurate and automated updates to input sheets."
Post-Implementation
"Deploy the solution, monitor performance, and continuously refine based on feedback to maximize efficiency and accuracy in GTRS testing."
