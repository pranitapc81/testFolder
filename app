### **Development Feedback:**

Adina has taken significant steps in expanding her technical skill set by learning new technologies, such as Power BI and Autosys, which could be valuable for future projects. She also made contributions at the beginning of the year on Sentinel service bus and Angular tasks, showing her adaptability to different tech stacks. Furthermore, her involvement in volunteering opportunities and the UI/UX guild demonstrates her eagerness to engage with the broader company community and upskill.

However, there are areas where improvement is needed. The transition from Java to Python, especially in the context of the Testplan project, seemed challenging for Adina, which affected the speed of her deliveries. **As one team member mentioned**, *“Adina could benefit from dedicating more time to mastering Python to speed up her contributions to the project.”* This gap has been observed in tasks where quicker Python proficiency was needed, leading to delays.

Moreover, her performance on specific tasks, like the exception check, required multiple follow-ups, and the deadlines she set were often missed. **Another colleague noted**, *“It’s difficult to rely on Adina for urgent tasks due to missed timelines and slow progress.”* To improve her effectiveness, it’s recommended that Adina focuses on enhancing her Python skills and sets clearer, realistic timelines with proactive updates. Leveraging her newly acquired skills, especially in Power BI, can further strengthen her impact on team projects. Assigning her tasks aligned with her strengths while encouraging her to improve in areas like Python will allow her to contribute more effectively.



Understood. Let's make each section more distinct while still highlighting the positive contributions and addressing the areas of improvement without repeating the same content. Here's the revised version:

### **Performance and Impact:**

Adina has actively worked on expanding her skill set this year by learning new tools such as Power BI and Autosys. She’s also made significant contributions in backend database structuring, which has supported data consistency across various projects. Her willingness to acquire new skills shows her commitment to growth and adds value to the team’s technical capabilities.

However, her overall deliveries for the Testplan project have been limited. An example of this is the exception check task, which took longer than expected, with multiple follow-ups required to get it completed. Despite committing to timelines, there were delays, impacting the team's ability to move forward with other dependent tasks. **A team member shared**, *“It’s often difficult to plan when tasks assigned to Adina are delayed without clear communication.”* To increase her impact, it would be beneficial for her to improve on task prioritization and provide clearer, more reliable timelines to ensure the smooth flow of deliverables.

### **Risk and Controls:**

Adina’s proactive approach to learning Power BI is commendable, as it shows her eagerness to support the team’s analytics needs in the future. Her experience with database structuring has helped in maintaining data accuracy, which is crucial for compliance and regulatory reporting. This can be an asset in managing data integrity risks moving forward.

However, there have been instances where delayed task completion caused a ripple effect, impacting other team members' work. For example, the exception check task’s delays blocked progress on interdependent projects, causing a bottleneck in the overall workflow. **One of her peers mentioned**, *“When Adina’s tasks are delayed, it often puts our timeline at risk, affecting other deliverables.”* To mitigate such risks, Adina could benefit from improving her communication regarding task status and ensuring better alignment with team timelines, especially on critical path items.

### **Culture and Values:**

Adina has shown strong engagement in company-wide volunteer activities, like participating in park cleanups, food delivery drives, and the JFF program, demonstrating her commitment to corporate social responsibility. Additionally, her involvement in initiatives like the Women in Tech coaching circle and the UI/UX guild shows her dedication to self-improvement and community involvement.

However, within the team, her engagement could be enhanced. She is often less visible in team meetings, such as biweekly sync-ups and stand-up calls, which can lead to a disconnect in understanding the team's current focus areas. **As one team member noted**, *“We often don’t know what Adina is working on since she doesn’t provide regular updates in team meetings.”* By increasing her presence in these meetings and sharing regular updates, she can improve collaboration and foster a stronger team connection, making her contributions more visible and impactful.

### **Development Feedback:**

Adina’s initiative in learning about Power BI and Autosys reflects her drive to broaden her technical expertise, which could be highly beneficial for upcoming projects. She also contributed to Sentinel service bus and Angular tasks at the start of the year, showcasing her ability to adapt to different technologies.

On the flip side, there is a need for Adina to take more ownership of her tasks. For example, while working on the exception check task, there were significant delays, requiring multiple reminders, and the timelines initially committed to were missed. **A team member commented**, *“Due to slower deliveries and missed deadlines, it’s challenging to assign high-priority tasks to Adina.”* To address this, it’s recommended that she focus on clearly defining her task plans, set realistic timelines, and communicate proactively to avoid delays. It would also be beneficial for the team to identify opportunities where Adina can apply her newly acquired skills in Power BI and Autosys to add more value to ongoing and future initiatives.
