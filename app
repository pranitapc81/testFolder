We are in the process of developing a new functionality for cloning EQD messages. These messages are stored in the `.gpb` format, and the cloning process requires a systematic approach. The first and most critical step is to identify the specific fields within the `.gpb` message that are responsible for triggering the generation of a new trade. Once these key fields are accurately identified, the subsequent step involves modifying their values appropriately to meet the requirements of the new trade. Following this, the updated message will be transmitted to the GTRs (Global Trade Repositories), which will ultimately result in the creation of a new trade record.

### Key Challenge:
The primary challenge lies in precisely identifying the fields that influence the generation of a new trade. Additionally, determining their exact paths within the `.gpb` structure adds a layer of complexity. This task is crucial because any inaccuracies in field identification or path resolution could lead to errors in the cloning process, impacting the validity of the newly created trade.
