Certainly! Here’s a detailed evaluation for Adina, incorporating both positive aspects and areas for improvement across all the specified categories. Each section starts with the positive points, followed by constructive feedback, including examples and dialogue quotes, and ends with suggestions for improvement.

### **Performance and Impact:**

Adina has shown commendable initiative in expanding her skill set, having taken the time to learn new technologies like Power BI and Autosys. This proactive approach indicates her willingness to adapt and grow within the team. Additionally, she made early contributions to the Sentinel service bus and Angular tasks, demonstrating her capability to handle a diverse set of technical requirements. Her involvement in learning opportunities and extracurricular activities, such as Women in Tech coaching circles and volunteering for community service, showcases her commitment to continuous improvement and team spirit.

However, when it comes to her core assignments, especially within the Testplan project, Adina's overall contributions have been limited. Her deliveries this year have been slower compared to other team members, particularly on critical tasks like the exception handling project. This task required multiple follow-ups, and despite having set timelines, she missed these on several occasions, which ultimately delayed the project. **A team member remarked**, *“It feels like we're often waiting on Adina’s tasks to move forward, which can be challenging when we're on tight schedules.”* 

To improve, Adina could focus on enhancing her time management skills and being more consistent in meeting deadlines. Establishing clear timelines for her deliverables and communicating them proactively would ensure better alignment with team expectations.

### **Risk and Controls:**

Adina has demonstrated some understanding of the database structuring tasks assigned to her, which has added value to certain aspects of the Testplan project. Her efforts in connecting with various teams for search requests reflect her willingness to engage with broader organizational stakeholders. She has also been proactive in learning about risk-related frameworks, which can be an asset if leveraged properly.

On the other hand, there have been instances where her slower delivery pace has impacted interdependent tasks. For example, when working on interlinked activities related to data validation, delays from her side caused blockers for other team members who were waiting on her outputs to proceed. **One colleague mentioned**, *“Adina’s tasks are often critical for the next steps, and delays on her part sometimes hold up the entire chain of work.”* Additionally, her approach to these tasks lacks the structured planning necessary to mitigate risks, which could have been avoided with better preparation and foresight.

Moving forward, it would be beneficial for Adina to focus on understanding the dependencies of her tasks and their impact on the broader team. Developing a habit of early risk identification and communicating any potential delays could improve the efficiency of team workflows.

### **Culture and Values:**

Adina’s engagement in volunteering opportunities, such as park cleanups and community service, reflects her positive attitude towards team culture and social responsibility. She has also been involved in initiatives like the UI/UX guild, which highlights her eagerness to learn new things beyond her immediate responsibilities. Her participation in these programs has been well-received, showing that she is willing to contribute to the team’s culture beyond her day-to-day tasks.

However, her involvement in team collaboration, especially in project-related discussions, has been noticeably limited. She tends to be less vocal during team meetings and often misses biweekly sync-ups and stand-up calls. This has led to a lack of clarity among her peers regarding her ongoing work. **As one team member observed**, *“We rarely get updates from Adina, and it’s tough to track her progress without explicit check-ins.”* This limited engagement can be a hindrance when trying to maintain a cohesive team dynamic, as her absence in discussions means she misses out on valuable insights that could aid her own work.

Encouraging Adina to be more proactive in participating in team meetings and discussions would help her integrate better with the team. Being present and actively engaging in conversations could also open up more collaborative opportunities for her.

### **Development Feedback:**

Adina has shown a keen interest in expanding her technical capabilities, particularly in new areas like Power BI and Autosys, although she has not yet applied these skills in significant projects. Her willingness to upskill indicates potential for future contributions, especially if she can find tasks where these skills are relevant. Additionally, her early support on Angular tasks showcased her adaptability in taking on varied challenges.

However, one area where Adina has struggled is in her transition from Java to Python, which has been a critical focus for the team’s current Testplan efforts. **A colleague pointed out**, *“The transition from Java to Python seems to be particularly challenging for Adina, and this is impacting her speed on Python-based tasks.”* This skill gap became evident when she was assigned Python-based automation work, where progress was slower than anticipated. Additionally, there were concerns around her ownership of tasks. For instance, the exception handling project took longer than expected, requiring frequent follow-ups, and even then, it was completed only after multiple reminders.

To enhance her technical impact, Adina should focus on strengthening her Python skills, as this will allow her to take on more significant responsibilities within the Testplan project. Seeking guidance on best practices and engaging in hands-on projects could help her gain confidence in this area. Moreover, clear planning and committing to realistic timelines could improve her delivery rates and reliability.
