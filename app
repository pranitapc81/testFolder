### **Professional Development:**

Kshitij has shown a solid foundation in QA and system validation, particularly with his work on the **CATSUB** and Kafka migration projects. However, there is an opportunity for him to expand his skills further, especially in the area of Testplan development. By getting more involved in Testplan-related features, Kshitij can deepen his understanding of the different functionalities and contribute to enhancing its capabilities. It would be beneficial for him to proactively take ownership of Testplan development tasks, collaborating closely with **Sourav**, who has expertise in this area. This collaboration could also provide him with a chance to broaden his skills and bring fresh ideas to the table.

Additionally, Kshitij could take on a mentoring role to support junior team members by sharing his expertise, particularly in **automation and testing frameworks**. He could guide new joiners, helping them get onboarded faster and more effectively. Enhancing his Python skills would also be advantageous, enabling him to contribute to automation efforts and non-BAU (Business-As-Usual) projects, thereby broadening his technical capabilities.

Overall, Kshitij is performing well, but by focusing on these areas of professional development, he can add even more value to the team and further grow his career. For instance, actively seeking out non-BAU projects and taking initiative in complex Testplan tasks will not only enhance his skill set but also boost his visibility within the team.
