**Feedback on Santhosh Vamsi**  

Santhosh has been actively contributing to regression-related activities. While he encountered some challenges with initial Python development tasks for the Trade Cloning tool despite KT, he has shown a keen interest in the Power BI reporting module. Once the foundational work is in place, he will be involved in Power BI tasks along with the team.  

**Skill Ratings:**  
- **Technical Skills (Python):** Not evaluated due to primary focus on regression activities  
- **Communication Skills:** 3.5/5  
- **Delivery Quality:** 3/5  

Overall, Santhosh is performing steadily in his current role. With more exposure to development tasks and Power BI, he has the potential to expand his contributions further.
