Here's the updated feedback for **Ankita**, incorporating your points:

---

### **Performance and Impact:**

Ankita has contributed to the team by working on the purging of test cases in Testplan. She worked on writing scripts for purging test cases from the database, which was essential for maintaining data accuracy and cleanliness. However, due to the lack of concrete timelines for this task, the team had to resort to a manual workaround to purge test cases from the database, which slowed down the process. One team member mentioned, “Ankita was working on purging the test cases, but due to unclear timelines, we had to manually handle the task to keep things moving.” While Ankita has demonstrated her technical skills, it is important for her to focus on delivering her tasks on time, with clear and defined timelines. Moving forward, Ankita should take ownership of her tasks and ensure that she commits to the deadlines, as this would help the team avoid workarounds. Additionally, Ankita should focus on speeding up the completion of her other tasks, such as search-related work, which have been delayed. A peer shared, “Ankita’s involvement in search tasks has been slower than anticipated, and it’s impacting the overall project timeline.” With more proactive planning and commitment, Ankita can significantly improve her performance and the team's efficiency.

### **Risk and Controls:**

Ankita has contributed positively to the team, especially with the purging of test cases from the database. However, there is room for improvement in managing risk and controls. Due to delays in completing her tasks, particularly around the search-related work, other interdependent tasks were blocked, and it impacted the progress of the team. As one team member shared, “We had to wait for Ankita to finish her tasks, and that delayed the completion of other linked tasks.” It’s important for Ankita to proactively manage the risk of delays and communicate with the team about potential blockers. In the case of the purging task, because Ankita did not provide a clear timeline, the team had to manually handle the purge process as a workaround. One peer mentioned, “We had to resort to a manual solution because we didn’t know when Ankita’s task would be completed.” Going forward, Ankita needs to ensure that she is delivering on time and communicating any potential delays ahead of time. If she commits to deadlines and regularly checks in with the team on her progress, she can help mitigate risks associated with delays. Additionally, by taking more ownership of her tasks, she can help the team avoid workarounds and bottlenecks in the future.

### **Culture and Values:**

Ankita has shown a strong commitment to the company’s culture by actively participating in volunteering opportunities such as food deliveries, park cleanups, and various community outreach programs. One team member remarked, "Ankita is always ready to volunteer, which highlights her dedication to contributing to causes outside of work." Her participation in the Women in Tech coaching circle and the UI/UX guild is also commendable, as it demonstrates her enthusiasm for continuous learning and her desire to expand her knowledge base. Ankita’s willingness to contribute to external initiatives not only enhances her own personal growth but also adds value to the company’s cultural fabric. Her efforts in engaging with these activities have been appreciated by the team, and she should continue to embrace these learning opportunities. Furthermore, Ankita’s ability to balance her technical work with extracurricular commitments is a strength that sets a positive example for her peers. To further enhance her contributions to the company culture, Ankita could look for ways to share insights from her external engagements, whether through team discussions or knowledge-sharing sessions. This will allow her to inspire others and help foster a collaborative, learning-oriented environment within the team.

### **Development Feedback:**

Ankita has made progress in developing her technical skills, particularly with purging test cases from the database and her initial work on HUTI automation. However, one area that still needs attention is her transition from Java to Python. A colleague mentioned, "Ankita has been learning Python, but she’s still adjusting to some of the nuances, which has slowed her down in some tasks." This transition from Java to Python has proven to be challenging, and Ankita would benefit from focusing on this learning curve. By practicing Python more consistently and seeking help when needed, Ankita can improve her proficiency and speed. Additionally, Ankita needs to engage more with QAs and other team members to fully understand project requirements. One team member shared, “Ankita could benefit from having more frequent discussions with the QAs to clarify requirements and potential enhancements for the project.” Understanding requirements upfront will help her minimize delays and ensure that she is delivering work that meets expectations. In terms of taking ownership, Ankita needs to ensure that she follows through on the tasks she picks up. A peer noted, “Ankita needs to commit to clear timelines and communicate better about her progress.” Regular updates on her tasks and a proactive approach in providing status updates would also help her improve her reliability. Furthermore, Ankita has not yet fully utilized tools like Power BI and Autosys, despite having learned about them. Applying these skills to upcoming tasks could increase her versatility and effectiveness in the role. By improving her communication, ownership, and technical skills, Ankita can make a significant impact on the team’s success.
