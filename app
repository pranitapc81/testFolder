Here is the detailed feedback for **Ankita**, incorporating both positive and constructive points, examples, and dialogues:

---

### **Performance and Impact:**

Ankita has shown her technical capabilities, especially in managing tasks related to Erebus and Testplan. When she initially took on Erebus, she worked diligently to understand the scope of the project and started managing the tasks. One team member commented, “Ankita’s ability to dive into new tasks and manage them is impressive, especially when she’s working on complex projects like Erebus.” However, Ankita has faced challenges in making significant progress on certain tasks. For example, the EQS HUTI automation task, which she was assigned, saw limited progress and had to be handed over to another team member. As one peer mentioned, "Ankita’s pace on certain tasks was slower, and we had to wait for updates or chase for timelines." This slower delivery is something that Ankita needs to work on, as it can impact the overall progress of the team. Ankita’s contributions to Power BI and the database structuring tasks have been valuable, though more consistent input would help increase her overall impact. Moving forward, Ankita should work on breaking tasks down into more manageable chunks, ensuring clear timelines and making sure her commitments are met. While she has shown the ability to understand new concepts, the lack of timely updates and slower pace can hinder the team’s ability to make progress. Improved planning and a proactive approach will help her improve in this area.

### **Risk and Controls:**

Ankita's involvement in risk and controls-related tasks has had a mixed outcome. On the positive side, she has shown the ability to collaborate with the team and has helped with certain foundational tasks. One example is her involvement in structuring tables for the database, which contributed to smoother integration and setup for other tasks. One colleague noted, “Ankita helped in setting up key tables that improved our workflow in the Testplan project.” However, her slower task completion has led to interdependent tasks getting blocked. For example, certain tasks related to EQS HUTI automation were delayed, which affected the team's ability to move forward with other linked tasks. This situation arose when Ankita struggled to meet deadlines and missed providing clear timelines. One team member remarked, “We were waiting on Ankita’s task to be completed, and it was holding up other dependent work." Ankita needs to be more mindful of the interlinked nature of tasks and focus on reducing delays. Being more proactive with setting clear timelines and communicating delays can help mitigate such risks. Regularly checking in with the team and understanding the impact of her tasks on others would help reduce bottlenecks and improve the overall risk management within the team.

### **Culture and Values:**

Ankita has shown a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Her involvement in the company’s volunteering activities, such as food deliveries and park cleanups, is a reflection of her dedication to contributing to the team beyond work. One colleague shared, “Ankita has been an active participant in volunteering events, which shows her commitment to the company’s culture of giving back to the community.” Additionally, Ankita joined the Women in Tech coaching circle, further demonstrating her eagerness to grow and learn in her professional journey. This shows her openness to personal development and contributing to the wider community. Ankita also joined the UI/UX guild, where she is engaging with new learning opportunities, which adds value to her skillset. By continuing to participate in these extracurricular activities and showing her team-oriented mindset, Ankita is aligning with the company’s culture and values. However, to fully integrate herself into the team, she could engage more with team discussions and share her learnings from these extracurriculars. Her willingness to contribute to the team’s culture should be mirrored by proactive communication and visibility in team interactions. Being more present in team meetings and offering insights from her outside learning experiences would enhance her cultural alignment with the team.

### **Development Feedback:**

Ankita’s transition from Java to Python has been a challenge, which was noticed by some of her colleagues. One team member observed, “It seems like the transition between Java and Python is a bit difficult for Ankita. She is still adjusting to Python, which has slowed her progress on certain tasks.” While she has demonstrated an ability to learn, this transition requires more focus and practice to ensure smoother execution in Python-related tasks. Ankita’s ability to independently dive into new projects is admirable, but for Python, she could benefit from additional support or resources to make her learning curve less steep. One peer suggested, “If Ankita could collaborate more with the team, especially those with more Python experience, she could speed up her learning and application in future projects.” Another area for development is her communication with QAs and other team members. While Ankita is technically strong, she could benefit from discussing requirements and potential enhancements more with the QAs. Regular discussions on new features, requirements, and project enhancements will help Ankita understand the complete picture and deliver higher-quality work. Additionally, Ankita could further expand her involvement by tackling tasks that require her to apply newly learned skills, such as Power BI, which she has yet to fully integrate into her day-to-day work. She has demonstrated an eagerness to learn but must ensure that she applies these skills consistently across different tasks. Regular check-ins with the team and discussing the enhancement or requirements for new tasks will improve Ankita’s impact and help her progress more smoothly.
