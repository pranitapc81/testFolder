Culture and Values:
Ankita has been making an effort to connect with the team and build positive relationships. She actively reaches out to QAs to help them with their Power BI-related issues and has been collaborating with the EQD HUTI QAs to understand their requirements better. A colleague mentioned, “Ankita has been connecting well with the QAs and has been helpful in resolving issues related to Power BI.” Her proactive engagement with the team to understand requirements shows her commitment to teamwork and collaboration. However, Ankita could benefit from being more present in the biweekly team and stand-up calls. Her attendance in these calls has been inconsistent, and more participation would help her stay aligned with the team and better understand ongoing work. One team member said, “It would be great if Ankita joined more of the stand-up calls so that she can stay in the loop and contribute to discussions more actively.” Despite this, Ankita has demonstrated strong communication skills, as she presents her ideas and solutions clearly. She could further improve her visibility within the team by engaging more frequently during meetings and offering suggestions on ongoing projects. Her engagement with both internal and external teams has been commendable, and she should continue fostering these relationships to strengthen her team collaboration.

Development Feedback:
Ankita has shown solid technical skills, especially in areas such as purging test cases and contributing to HUTI automation. However, there are areas where she could improve to enhance her development performance. One team member mentioned that Ankita required repeated knowledge transfers (KTs) on the Erebus project, which consumed a significant amount of time. As the team member shared, “Ankita needed multiple KTs on Erebus, and it took up considerable time that could have been used for other tasks.” To avoid this in the future, Ankita could explore the material and resources on her own first before seeking KTs. Recording the sessions and reviewing them as needed could help reduce the time spent on re-explaining concepts. Additionally, another team member noted, “Ankita should dedicate more focused time to her tasks to meet her timelines.” Planning ahead, understanding potential challenges, and setting realistic timelines for her work are essential. Ankita needs to ensure that she shares these timelines with the team upfront, so expectations are aligned. Furthermore, a few instances required chasing her for updates, which can impact team efficiency. One team member said, “We had to follow up several times to get updates on Ankita’s tasks, which slowed down the progress.” In terms of development work, Ankita should also ensure that existing functionality is not broken when implementing new features. This will help avoid additional issues and streamline the development process. By being more organized and taking ownership of her tasks, Ankita can improve her delivery and become more efficient.
