**Subject:** Inquiry Regarding Extension of Yagna's Internship  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I hope this email finds you well.  

Yagna has been interning with me for the past five months, and his performance has been consistently good throughout this period. His dedication and contributions have been commendable. As per the current arrangement, his last working day is towards the end of January, and I have received a mail to initiate the termination checklist.  

Based on his positive feedback and performance, I wanted to inquire if there is a possibility to extend his internship. Please let me know the process or requirements if an extension can be considered.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
