Here is a slightly more detailed version for Adina's feedback:

---

### Performance and Impact:
Adina possesses a strong technical foundation and has contributed to the Testplan project with notable diligence. However, her task completions occasionally exceed anticipated timelines due to a need for more structured planning. For example, in a recent task where she was asked to add exception checks, she committed to a timeline but encountered delays, which impacted the workflow for connected tasks. To enhance her performance, Adina would benefit from a more organized approach, setting realistic deadlines and proactively managing her progress. By establishing a clear plan for each assignment and updating the team regularly, she could ensure timely delivery, contributing to smoother project outcomes and reducing any downstream impacts on the team.

### Risk and Controls:
Adina could improve the reliability of her contributions by taking a more proactive approach to task ownership and planning. Her tasks sometimes pose a risk to the project timeline when they extend beyond the original timeframe, particularly when other team members rely on her work for their own progress. Establishing concrete deadlines, communicating any anticipated obstacles, and addressing them early would help Adina mitigate these risks. Such a proactive approach would not only support her in managing her workload more effectively but also allow the team to provide support when needed, fostering a more collaborative working environment and enabling the team to maintain overall project momentum.

### Culture and Values:
While Adina has the technical potential to make valuable contributions, her level of engagement in team interactions could be strengthened to enhance collaboration and alignment. Her attendance at key team meetings, such as standups and biweekly project calls, has been somewhat inconsistent, which may limit her visibility into ongoing projects and the team’s shared objectives. By participating more actively in these meetings, she would gain a clearer understanding of team goals, see how her work fits into the larger picture, and stay informed on current developments. This increased presence would also facilitate more opportunities to collaborate with team members, building rapport and enabling her to contribute more meaningfully to the team’s culture and values.

### Development Feedback:
Adina’s professional growth could be further supported by adopting a more structured approach to task management and planning. By setting clear, realistic timelines for her work and updating the team regularly on her progress, she would improve her accountability and enhance her ability to manage deadlines more effectively. Breaking down her tasks into clear stages and communicating her milestones would allow her to anticipate challenges more easily and adjust as needed. Additionally, actively seeking feedback from her peers and mentors would help her align her work with project requirements and team expectations, creating a path for continuous improvement in her contributions.

### Overall Assessment:
Adina displays technical promise and has the foundation to become a more impactful contributor to the team. However, to fully realize this potential, she should focus on enhancing her ability to set and meet deadlines, taking ownership of her tasks with thorough planning, and providing regular updates to ensure alignment with the team’s goals. Being more present in team discussions, including important meetings and updates, would offer her greater insights into project requirements and help her integrate her efforts within the team’s overall progress. Focusing on clear communication, proactive task management, and accountability will help Adina increase her impact on the team and provide a clearer, more predictable path toward completing her assignments. With these adjustments, she has the potential to become a stronger contributor in both the short and long term.



Performance and Impact:
Ankita has worked on various projects, including Erebus and Testplan, where she has shown commitment to her tasks, though her contributions could be more concrete. For instance, while she managed her responsibilities on the Erebus project, she made fewer visible PR (pull request) commits, which limited the visibility of her progress. Additionally, feedback suggests she often required guidance from team members instead of independently exploring project details. 

On the EQS HUTI automation task, she encountered delays, and progress was slower than expected, ultimately leading to the task being reassigned to Vibhuti, who completed it. Her ongoing assignments on EQD HUTI automation and test case deactivation similarly highlight the importance of setting clear timelines and following through on commitments. By establishing a habit of documenting her work more consistently and creating structured plans for each task, Ankita can further strengthen her performance and make a more measurable impact on the team’s objectives.


Risk and Control:
In terms of managing risk and ensuring control, Ankita's approach could benefit from more structured planning and a proactive stance in managing her tasks. For instance, on the Erebus project, there were instances where her reliance on team members for explanations took time away from independent exploration, which would have helped her get a stronger initial grasp of the project. This can introduce potential risks in project timelines, as delays in independent understanding can impact the team’s overall progress.

Additionally, when tasks are assigned, she could improve by providing well-defined timelines and committing to them. This approach will not only minimize any risk of project delays but also improve predictability in her deliverables, allowing the team to better plan around her contributions. For example, tasks like deactivating test cases and automation in EQD could benefit from clear deadlines to help keep the project on track. By adopting a more proactive approach to ownership and structure, Ankita can better manage the risk factors associated with her responsibilities, ensuring smoother execution and consistency across her assigned projects.

Culture and Values:
Ankita demonstrates a willingness to connect with others and seek information, as evidenced in her outreach efforts related to the Secarch requests. However, feedback indicates that these interactions did not yield new insights, as the findings largely reiterated existing information. This outcome suggests that Ankita could benefit from refining her approach to research and seeking guidance more strategically. To better align with team culture, she could also benefit from participating more actively in meetings and project discussions, which would allow her to gain insights directly and reduce reliance on peers to bridge knowledge gaps. Additionally, being more present and engaged with the team could enhance her integration into the team’s culture and foster more collaborative relationships.

Development Feedback:
A key area for Ankita’s development is improving her ability to independently explore project requirements and tasks before seeking clarification. For example, on the Erebus project, more self-driven exploration could have minimized the time spent by others explaining fundamental aspects of the project to her. Currently, she is working on the EQD HUTI automation and deactivation of test cases, but concrete timelines are yet to be set despite multiple follow-ups. Structuring her tasks with a clearer plan and committing to realistic deadlines would help her manage her workload more effectively and demonstrate accountability in her deliverables. Enhancing her planning and commitment to timelines will be beneficial for her growth.

Overall Assessment:
Overall, Ankita has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the team, but to fully leverage her abilities, she should focus on building more structured task management skills and independently navigating project requirements. By establishing a habit of proactive learning and exploration, she could reduce the need for extensive explanations from her peers, freeing up team resources and building her knowledge more effectively. Additionally, she would benefit from improving her availability and engagement with team calls, which would help her stay in sync with ongoing projects and be more responsive to team needs. By setting clearer timelines and taking ownership of her work, Ankita can enhance her reliability within the team and position herself to make a more consistent impact.
