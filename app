Here’s the updated **Risk and Controls** section with the corrected information:

### **Risk and Controls:**

Adina’s delayed task completion has created several instances where interdependent tasks were blocked, affecting other team members. Her delayed deliveries have caused a ripple effect, delaying subsequent tasks that were linked to hers. **For example**, when she was working on the exception check task for Testplan, it caused a delay in the progress of other team members’ tasks that were dependent on its completion. This situation has led to frustration within the team, as they couldn’t move forward with their work while waiting for updates from Adina. **One peer noted**, *“We were unable to move forward on some critical tasks because we were waiting for updates from Adina.”* This not only affects team efficiency but also creates a backlog of work, putting additional strain on others to compensate for the delays. If Adina could improve in managing her tasks with better planning, clear timelines, and better communication, the team’s workflow would be smoother and more productive. Additionally, it’s important that she communicates early if there are any issues that will cause delays, so others can adjust their work accordingly. A more proactive approach will help minimize risks and disruptions to the project flow, ensuring that the team can rely on her to meet deadlines without waiting for long periods of time.

### **Overall Assessment for Adina:**

Adina has shown potential in certain areas of her work but has faced challenges in terms of consistent delivery and communication. While she can complete tasks when they are well defined, there have been significant delays in completing assignments and difficulties with prioritization. Her involvement in team discussions and meetings has been minimal, making it harder for others to stay updated on her progress. The delays and lack of proactive communication have sometimes caused bottlenecks for the team and affected the timely delivery of other interdependent tasks. However, with improved planning, clearer timelines, and better collaboration, Adina has the potential to make more meaningful contributions to the team. Her ability to learn and understand technical concepts is evident, but a more structured approach to task management will help her become more reliable in her role.

**Performance and Impact:**

Adina’s overall performance this year in terms of deliveries for Testplan has been lower than expected. When assigned tasks, especially for tasks such as the exception checks, multiple follow-ups were required, and the timelines were missed repeatedly. Despite receiving reminders, the task was only completed after several rounds of chasing. **For example**, the exception check task had to be broken into smaller pieces to ensure some level of progress was made. On several occasions, Adina was unable to provide clear timelines when asked, and when timelines were provided, they were often missed. **One peer mentioned**, *"Adina seems to take longer than expected on tasks, and it slows everything down for the team."* This ongoing delay in delivering results has been a challenge, and it is affecting the pace of the team’s overall progress. While she does have potential, Adina needs to work on prioritizing tasks, adhering to timelines, and communicating more effectively about any obstacles. A more focused and proactive approach would lead to better performance and less impact on team momentum.

**Risk and Controls:**

Adina’s delayed task completion has created several instances where interdependent tasks were blocked, affecting other team members. Her delayed deliveries have caused a ripple effect, delaying subsequent tasks that were linked to hers. **For example**, the EQD automation task, which was initially assigned to her, was delayed due to lack of progress and was eventually reassigned to another team member. This situation has led to frustration within the team, as interdependent work couldn’t progress as planned. **A peer noted**, *“We were unable to move forward on some critical tasks because we were waiting for updates from Adina.”* This not only affects team efficiency but also creates a backlog of work that puts additional strain on others. If Adina could improve in managing her tasks with better planning and timelines, the team’s workflow would be smoother and more productive. Additionally, it’s important that she communicates early if there are issues that will cause delays so that others can adjust their work accordingly. A more proactive approach will help minimize risks and disruptions to the project flow.

**Culture and Values:**

Adina’s contribution to team culture and communication has been less than expected. She has not been actively participating in team meetings or calls, making it difficult for others to stay informed about her progress and challenges. **One peer mentioned**, *“We’re often unsure of what Adina is working on, and that affects our ability to collaborate effectively.”* Her lack of communication and minimal engagement in team calls has created a gap in understanding her workload and priorities. For better collaboration and to build stronger team dynamics, it is crucial for Adina to be more present during meetings and communicate more frequently about her tasks and challenges. Being an active participant in meetings will help her gain better insights into other team members' work and offer her the chance to voice concerns or ask for help. This will improve teamwork and ensure that Adina’s work is better aligned with the team’s overall objectives. **One more peer noted**, *“Her lack of communication makes it difficult to gauge the progress of her tasks and hampers the team’s ability to adjust and plan accordingly.”* Therefore, Adina’s engagement in team discussions and her visibility within the team will significantly help her and the group.

**Development Feedback:**

Adina’s approach to development and task management requires improvement in terms of planning, time management, and ownership. **For instance**, when given a task, such as the exception check in Testplan, she struggled to define a clear timeline and often missed the deadlines. **One peer noted**, *“Adina has difficulty committing to timelines, and when she does commit, she doesn’t always follow through.”* Additionally, when asked for updates or timelines, she often provided vague responses, which made it harder for the team to depend on her deliverables. This lack of concrete planning and commitment to deadlines has slowed down the overall progress of the team. **For example**, on multiple occasions, priority tasks could not be assigned to her as the team was unsure whether she would deliver on time. This made it challenging for the team to move forward with the planned priorities. **One colleague observed**, *“It’s hard to prioritize tasks for Adina because her timeline commitment is unclear, and there is no clear delivery date in sight.”* For Adina to be more effective in her role, it is essential for her to take ownership of her tasks, set clear timelines, and communicate any challenges early on so that the team can adapt accordingly. A more structured and accountable approach to task management would help improve her performance and build trust within the team.

**Positive Feedback:**

While there have been areas for improvement, Adina has shown that she can perform well when given clear instructions and a well-defined scope. **For example**, when she was assigned a task with detailed specifications, she was able to complete it to the expected standard. She has shown a willingness to learn and a good understanding of the work when she is given proper guidance. Additionally, Adina has the potential to take on more responsibility and contribute to the team in a more proactive way. With improved communication and time management skills, she can become a more reliable and effective member of the team. If Adina works on increasing her visibility, managing timelines more effectively, and engaging in team discussions, her contributions will become more impactful, and she will be able to deliver high-quality results in a more timely manner.
