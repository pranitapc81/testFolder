Here’s the updated **Risk and Controls** section with the corrected information:

### **Risk and Controls:**

Adina’s delayed task completion has created several instances where interdependent tasks were blocked, affecting other team members. Her delayed deliveries have caused a ripple effect, delaying subsequent tasks that were linked to hers. **For example**, when she was working on the exception check task for Testplan, it caused a delay in the progress of other team members’ tasks that were dependent on its completion. This situation has led to frustration within the team, as they couldn’t move forward with their work while waiting for updates from Adina. **One peer noted**, *“We were unable to move forward on some critical tasks because we were waiting for updates from Adina.”* This not only affects team efficiency but also creates a backlog of work, putting additional strain on others to compensate for the delays. If Adina could improve in managing her tasks with better planning, clear timelines, and better communication, the team’s workflow would be smoother and more productive. Additionally, it’s important that she communicates early if there are any issues that will cause delays, so others can adjust their work accordingly. A more proactive approach will help minimize risks and disruptions to the project flow, ensuring that the team can rely on her to meet deadlines without waiting for long periods of time.
