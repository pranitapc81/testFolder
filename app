**Hello everyone,**

Today, I want to share a solution we have developed that is transforming the way our QA team prepares input data for testing. 

To start with, let me explain the current process and some of the key challenges we face. Right now, when we get a new trade or asset class to test, our QA team has to go through Jira tickets manually to gather the input data. They have to carefully read through each ticket, understand the descriptions provided, and then manually prepare the necessary field values for each trade, asset class, and mandate. This has to be repeated for every trade and across all asset classes.

As you can imagine, this manual data gathering process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Since it’s entirely manual, it’s also prone to errors – misinterpretations, missed fields, or simply fatigue from repetitive work can lead to inaccuracies. These errors, in turn, impact the effectiveness of our testing, and ultimately, the quality of the product we deliver.

So, to address these challenges, we have developed an automated process that significantly improves efficiency and accuracy. This new process automates the data preparation process by leveraging APIs and an AI model to extract, interpret, and generate the required input data.

Here’s how it works: each time we run a test and there are fields that fail or need additional input, the system identifies those specific fields. Instead of having a QA manually go through the Jira tickets for each failed field, our process now uses Jira APIs to pull the Jira description directly. This means that the system fetches the relevant information straight from Jira without needing any manual intervention.

Once the Jira description is obtained, we create a prompt for the missing or failed field. This prompt, which is essentially a query, is based on the Jira description. We then pass this prompt to the GPT-4 Turbo model. The model interprets the prompt and provides the appropriate field value based on the trade information provided in the Jira description. This value is automatically added to the input sheet for the next execution.

By automating this process, we are achieving multiple benefits. First, we’re saving a lot of time. The QA team no longer has to spend hours manually looking up and interpreting data, which allows them to focus more on the actual testing and quality assurance tasks. 

Second, this approach reduces the risk of human error. The manual process was not only time-consuming but also introduced potential errors because it relied on individual interpretation of each Jira description. With automation, we are minimizing the possibility of such errors, which makes the entire QA process more reliable.

Third, this process increases overall efficiency and optimization. We are making our data preparation workflow faster and more accurate, which leads to a smoother testing process. This means that our testing cycles are shorter, allowing us to deliver quality releases faster.

And finally, there’s a significant reduction in manual effort. This is a major boost for our QA team. Rather than spending time on repetitive tasks, the team can focus on higher-value activities, like analyzing test results and identifying areas of improvement in our testing process.

In summary, this new automated solution is helping us streamline our QA data preparation, reduce errors, and save time and effort. By implementing this approach, we’re improving not only the QA team’s productivity but also the overall quality of our product.

Thank you for listening, and I look forward to any questions you might have.
