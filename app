Thank you, David, for providing the contacts.

We already have a functional codebase to manipulate the provided GPB message. Our current focus is identifying the list of fields responsible for triggering a new trade generation. 

I reached out to several EQD developers, but unfortunately, they were unable to provide the required information. Thanouja facilitated connections with Hiten, Navya, and their team; however, due to capacity limitations and pre-existing commitments, our request could not be prioritized.
