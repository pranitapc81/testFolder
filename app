**Feedback on Santhosh Vamsi**  

Santhosh has been primarily engaged in regression-related activities. For his initial development tasks in Python, particularly for the Trade Cloning tool, he faced challenges despite receiving KT. However, he has shown interest in the Power BI reporting module, and once the foundational work is completed, he will be assigned tasks in that area along with the team.  

**Skill Ratings:**  
- **Technical Skills (Python):** Not evaluated due to focus on regression activities  
- **Communication Skills:** 3.5/5  
- **Delivery Quality:** 3/5  

Overall, Santhosh is performing well in regression-related tasks. There is potential for him to take on more responsibilities and contribute further as he gains experience and exposure to new areas.
