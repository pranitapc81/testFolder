Use Cases:
View Field-Level Details:

Primary Actor: User
Goal: View details at the field level based on selected filters.
Main Scenario:
User selects filters for execution type, mandate, asset class, and field name.
User clicks on the "Show" button.
System retrieves records matching the selected filters.
System displays a table with columns: execution type, execution time, mandate, asset class, which have the selected field.
Upon selecting a record, the system displays a table with columns: testcases, execution type, overall execution result, and details of the selected field (actual value, expected value, comparison status).
View Field History:

Primary Actor: User
Goal: View history of a field for a specific execution type, mandate, and asset class.
Main Scenario:
User selects filters for execution type, mandate, asset class, and field name.
System retrieves historical data for the selected field.
System displays a table with columns: execution type, execution time, mandate, asset class, actual value, expected value, and comparison status for the selected field.
Additional Flask Endpoints:
python
Copy code
@app.route('/view-field-details', methods=['POST'])
def view_field_details():
    # Implement logic to retrieve field-level details based on selected filters
    # Return a table with columns: execution type, execution time, mandate, asset class
    # which have the selected field
    return jsonify(field_details)

@app.route('/view-field-history', methods=['POST'])
def view_field_history():
    # Implement logic to retrieve history of a field for a specific execution type,
    # mandate, and asset class
    # Return a table with columns: execution type, execution time, mandate, asset class,
    # actual value, expected value, and comparison status for the selected field
    return jsonify(field_history)
Additional SQL Queries:
View Field-Level Details:
sql
Copy code
SELECT execution_type, execution_time, mandate, asset_class 
FROM field_details 
WHERE execution_type = :execution_type 
AND mandate = :mandate 
AND asset_class = :asset_class 
AND field_name = :field_name;
View Field History:
sql
Copy code
SELECT execution_type, execution_time, mandate, asset_class, actual_value, expected_value, comparison_status 
FROM field_history 
WHERE execution_type = :execution_type 
AND mandate = :mandate 
AND asset_class = :asset_class 
AND field_name = :field_name;
These additional use cases, endpoints, and SQL queries provide functionality for users to view details at the field level and access the history of a field for a specific execution type, mandate, and asset class. Adapt them as necessary to fit your specific requirements and database structure.

       SUM(CASE WHEN execution_result = 'Success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successful_executions,
       SUM(CASE WHEN execution_result = 'Failure' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS failed_executions
FROM testpack_executions 
WHERE execution_type = :execution_type 
AND mandate = :mandate 
AND asset_class = :asset_class 
AND execution_time BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date;
View Testpack Execution Trends:
sql
Copy code
SELECT DATE(execution_time) AS execution_date,
