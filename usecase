Use Cases:
Filter Testpacks:

Primary Actor: User

Main Scenario:
User selects filters for execution type, mandate, asset class, and date range.
User clicks on the "Show" button.
System retrieves testpacks matching the selected filters.
System displays testpacks in a table with columns: testpacks, mandates, asset class, and execution time.
View Testpack Details:

Primary Actor: User
Goal: View details of a selected testpack.
Main Scenario:
User selects a testpack from the filtered results.
System retrieves details of the selected testpack.
System displays details in a table with columns: test cases, overall execution result.
View Testcase Details:

Primary Actor: User
Goal: View details of a selected testcase within a testpack.
Main Scenario:
User selects a testcase from the details of a testpack.
System retrieves details of the selected testcase.
System displays details in a table with columns: field name, actual value, expected value, and comparison result.
Flask Endpoints:
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/filter-testpacks', methods=['GET'])
def filter_testpacks():
    # Implement filtering logic based on request parameters
    # Fetch and return filtered testpacks from the database
    return jsonify(filtered_testpacks)

@app.route('/testpack-details/<testpack_id>', methods=['GET'])
def testpack_details(testpack_id):
    # Fetch details of the specified testpack from the database
    return jsonify(testpack_details)

@app.route('/testcase-details/<testcase_id>', methods=['GET'])
def testcase_details(testcase_id):
    # Fetch details of the specified testcase from the database
    return jsonify(testcase_details)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
SQL Queries:
Filter Testpacks:
sql
Copy code
SELECT testpacks, mandates, asset_class, execution_time 
FROM testpacks 
WHERE execution_type = :execution_type 
AND mandate = :mandate 
AND asset_class = :asset_class 
AND execution_time BETWEEN :start_date AND :end_date;
Retrieve Testpack Details:
sql
Copy code
SELECT test_cases, overall_execution_result 
FROM testpack_details 
WHERE testpack_id = :testpack_id;
Retrieve Testcase Details:
sql
Copy code
SELECT field_name, actual_value, expected_value, comparison_result 
FROM testcase_details 
WHERE testcase_id = :testcase_id;
These are basic outlines, and you may need to adjust them based on your specific database schema and requirements. Also, you'd need to integrate these SQL queries within your Flask application using appropriate database libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy for SQL databases).

any more use cases, endpoints and queries
ChatGPT
Sure, here are a few more use cases, along with additional endpoints and SQL queries:

Use Cases:
Execute Testpack:

Primary Actor: User
Goal: Execute a testpack.
Main Scenario:
User selects a testpack to execute.
System executes the selected testpack.
System records the execution details.
View Execution History:

Primary Actor: User
Goal: View the execution history of testpacks.
Main Scenario:
User selects to view execution history.
System retrieves the execution history.
System displays the execution history in a table with columns: testpacks, mandates, asset class, execution time, and execution result.
Additional Flask Endpoints:
python
Copy code
@app.route('/execute-testpack/<testpack_id>', methods=['POST'])
def execute_testpack(testpack_id):
    # Execute the selected testpack and record execution details
    # Return success/failure message
    return jsonify({"message": "Testpack executed successfully."})

@app.route('/execution-history', methods=['GET'])
def execution_history():
    # Fetch execution history from the database
    return jsonify(execution_history_data)
Additional SQL Queries:
Execute Testpack:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO testpack_executions (testpack_id, execution_time, execution_result)
VALUES (:testpack_id, :execution_time, :execution_result);
Retrieve Execution History:
sql
Copy code
SELECT te.testpacks, te.mandates, te.asset_class, te.execution_time, te.execution_result 
FROM testpack_executions te
ORDER BY te.execution_time DESC;
These additional use cases, endpoints, and SQL queries enhance the functionality of the reporting feature by allowing users to execute testpacks and view the execution history. Again, adapt these as needed to fit your specific requirements and database schema.

User
any more
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are a couple more use cases, along with additional endpoints and SQL queries:

Use Cases:
Compare Execution Results:

Primary Actor: User
Goal: Compare execution results between different executions of the same testpack.
Main Scenario:
User selects a testpack to compare results.
System retrieves the execution history for the selected testpack.
System displays a comparison of execution results between different executions of the same testpack.
Export Report:

Primary Actor: User
Goal: Export the report data to a downloadable format.
Main Scenario:
User selects to export the report data.
System generates a downloadable file containing the report data.
Additional Flask Endpoints:
python
Copy code
@app.route('/compare-execution-results/<testpack_id>', methods=['GET'])
def compare_execution_results(testpack_id):
    # Fetch execution results for the selected testpack
    # Compare execution results between different executions
    # Return the comparison data
    return jsonify(comparison_data)

@app.route('/export-report', methods=['GET'])
def export_report():
    # Generate and return a downloadable file containing the report data
    return send_file(filename, as_attachment=True)
Additional SQL Queries:
Compare Execution Results:
sql
Copy code
SELECT te1.execution_time AS execution_time_1, te1.execution_result AS execution_result_1,
       te2.execution_time AS execution_time_2, te2.execution_result AS execution_result_2
FROM testpack_executions te1
JOIN testpack_executions te2 ON te1.testpack_id = te2.testpack_id
WHERE te1.execution_time < te2.execution_time
AND te1.testpack_id = :testpack_id
ORDER BY te1.execution_time DESC;
This query fetches the execution results of the same testpack for different execution times, allowing users to compare them.

Export Report:
This doesn't require a SQL query but involves generating a downloadable file containing the report data based on the filtered results.
These additional use cases, endpoints, and SQL queries provide more functionality and flexibility to the reporting feature, enabling users to perform comparisons and export the report data for further analysis. Adapt them as necessary based on your specific requirements and database structure.
